                <h2>Why was it formed?</h2>
                <p>In the late 80s, English football clubs were seen as lagging behind their continental counterparts. They couldn't compete with the transfer fees and salaries being offered which meant that the best foreign players in the world were all playing abroad. In the early 1990s, to try and close the gap, the Premier League was proposed.</p>

                <p>The idea was for the Premier League to have commercial independence from the rest of the Football League and The FA (The Football Association). This would allow them to sell their broadcasting rights to the highest bidder and mean that clubs could bring in a much larger share of money. All the First Division clubs, as well as The FA were in favour of the proposal.</p>

                <p>On May 27th 1992, the Premier League was officially formed with 22 clubs initially taking part. This was later reduced to 20 by relegating 4 clubs and only having 2 come up at the end of the 1994/95 season.</p>
